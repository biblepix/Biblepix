BiblePix is a Tcl program developed for the "Bible 2.0" project.
Bible 2.0 aims to publish "The Word" in a growing number of languages. 
"The Word" consists of two selected Bible verses for each day of the year.

BiblePix can display "The Word" in various ways:

 * in many languages
 * as background image on Windows & Linux Desktops
 * slideshow with personal photo collection
 * as e-mail signature
 * in the Linux terminal
 
Systems: Linux, Windows 
System requirements: Tcl/Tk library, additional packages tls, tDom and tkimg

I  N  S  T  A  L  L  A  T  I  O  N

Before installing BiblePix, make sure Tcl/Tk as well as the above-mentioned 
extra packages are present on your PC. Tcl/Tk is a system independent platform 
for many operating systems.

BiblePix Installer (see below) should be executed only once for first installation, 
since it overwrites all files. After that it is enough to run BiblePix Setup for updating.

BiblePix automatically chooses your "Home Directory" for installation, as this
is the recommended standard (see further down, "Place of Installation").


W I N D O W S

A) The hard way:

1. Download and run Tcl/Tk from Magicsplat or ActiveTcl: 

	° www.magicsplat.com/tcl-installer
	° www.activestate.com/activetcl/downloads

These packages contain all required Tcl programs.

NOTE: Before the next step, restart computer to make sure Tcl is properly registered!

2. Download the BiblePix Installer from

	www.bible2.net

and right-click to install (for option 'Open with...' choose 'Wish' or 'Tcl' application).

B) The easy way:

Download the "BiblePix Windows Installer" from biblepix.vollmar.ch . 
It will install everything automatically :-)


L I N U X

1. Installing Tcl/Tk: 
Most Linux distributions already contain Tcl/Tk, including the afore-mentioned 
extra packages. If any of it is missing you can easily install it before installing
BiblePix. Installation is possible through the package manager of your system, or
by entering a short command in your terminal.**

2. Download the BiblePix Installer from

	www.bible2.net

and double-click it to install.***


G I T

The Git installation method is system independent and works on all platforms 
where a version of Git is installed. The 'git' command should be issued in 
a subfolder of the Home directory, so as to guarantee write access (see below under
"Place of Installation).
Change to that directory and download (clone) BiblePix with the command:

	git clone https://github.com/Biblepix/Biblepix.git
 
Then change to the BiblePix folder and double-click on the file

	~/Biblepix/biblepix-setup.tcl

to start the Setup program.

Since the current Git version is under constant development, the correct functioning
of the program cannot be guaranteed. To download a stable version, enter the 
following address in your Internet browser:

	https://github.com/Biblepix/Biblepix/releases

and choose the desired release. After that do as described above.


P L A C E   O F   I N S T A L L A T I O N

Recommended standard for Linux: 

	/home/[USERNAME]/Biblepix/

and for Windows: 

	C:\Users\[USERNAME]\AppData\Local\Biblepix\

SETUP PROGRAM
By running the BiblePix Setup program you can set all functions with ease. 
The program can be started as follows:

	° from the program menu of your system
	° by right-click on the Desktop (Windows)
	° by right-click in the file manager (Linux Konqueror)
In case of problems:
	° double click on the program file in the file manager (path see above)
	° double click on the shell script in ~/bin (Linux)

In the 'Welcome' section you can view The Word in any installed language (to switch
click on the text surface).
By pressing the OK button the BiblePix configuration as well as the system settings**** 
for Autostart and background picture are saved. BiblePix is restarted.

DOWNLOADING BIBLE TEXTS
The functioning of BiblePix depends on the presence of Bible text files with
the ending .TWD, which can be downloaded from our server each year in many languages
and Bible versions. Downloading is up to the user and should be done through the 
Setup programm when a year comes to a close. This funcion is not automatic. 
The files are kept in the folder

	~/Biblepix/BibleTexts

Any redundent files from past years are deleted automatically by the Setup program.

PROGRAM UPDATES
BiblePix has an automatic update mechanism. If an Internet connection is present,
the Setup will check for any program updates and install them automatically. 
Thus your BiblePix is always up-to-date, re-installation is hardly ever needed.

PHOTO MANAGEMENT
BiblePix provides a few sample pictures which are scaled to screen size and copied
to the BiblePix Photo directory at first installation. However in the Setup program
you can add your own photos. These too are resized, if necessary, and copied over.
Original photos remain untouched.
From version 3.3, both the desired text position and the luminance of the text
colour are registered when adding a photo.

THE WORD ON A BACKGROUND PICTURE
The centre-piece of BiblePix is projecting The Word onto a background image. 
If the feature "Background Image" is activated in the Setup, BiblePix will take
a picture from the photo collection and adorn it with The Word from an available
Bible text file by random selection. If the funcion "Slideshow" is activated too,
this takes place at the given interval.
Depending on the operating system, one or two identical pictures of the formats:

	theword.tif
	theword.bmp
	theword.png

are saved to the Picture Folder:

	~/Biblepix/TodaysPicture/

The Bible text is written directly onto the picture with nice, readable shadow fonts. 
The size, colour and type of fonts as well as the text position can be set in the 
Setup program (for Hebrew and Arabic see footnote*****).
Displaying the background image as well switching images (in case of slideshow activated) 
are managed by the BiblePix main program. 

BiblePix Setup will try to automatically change the background picture of your Desktop; 
all Windows and most common Linux Desktops have been taken into account. If you encounter
problems you can easily set up your background picture manually by right-clicking on your
Desktop and instructing your system to use the above image path from now on. 

It shouldn't be necessary to set up a SLIDESHOW via your system desktop control, 
since BiblePix takes care of changing the picture at a given interval.
Attention Windows users: if the picture doesn't change on time, right-click on your Desktop 
and choose "Personalize > Wallpaper". There you can set up a slide show easily with the above 
picture path. The interval is taken automatically from the BiblePix Setup settings. 
You may have to rerun Setup for this to take effect.


EMAIL SIGNATURE

BiblePix has an extended feature called "Add The Word to your e-mail signatures".
If this is activated in the Setup, BiblePix will add The Word to your signature(s) 
once a day on the basis of any installed Bible text files. The signature files are 
stored by language shortcuts (e.g. signature-en_Englis.txt) in the directory:

	~/Biblepix/TodaysSignature/

You can edit these files from your e-mail program or in a text editor and add any
personal information (greetings, address etc.) at the top. Any text above the
separating line (======) remains untouched when The Word changes.
Finally you must instruct your e-mail program to use these files when sending an
e-mail (usually under Settings > Identities > Signatures).

For e-mail programs that manage signatures only internally (i.e. that cannot load
external files), BiblePix can handle Trojitá and Evolution for now. First time users
should go to 'IMAP > Settings > General' (Trojitá) / 'Settings > Editor > Signatures' 
(Evolution) and mark the desired identity. In the 'Edit' dialog add a new line saying 

  www.bible2.net
  
Henceforth BiblePix will insert 'The Word' in its place. (see footnote for Evolution******)

LINUX TERMINAL
Thanks to this extra feature BiblePix can display The Word in your Linux terminals.
If activated (only possible on Linux computers) BiblePix will create a shell script 
from any available Bible text file, to reside in:

	~/Biblepix/prog/unix/term.sh

The script is executed whenever you open a terminal. Display and colours can be 
customised by editing:

	~/Biblepix/prog/conf/term.conf

For term.sh to be executed automatically, the Setup program makes an entry in 
~/.bashrc. *****

*The configuration file is written by Setup and should not normally be touched by users.
If however after an update the Setup should no longer run, you can try deleting the file and
then restart the Setup. The configuration file allows the so-called "debug modus", to detect
program errors. To achieve this, set the value 'debug' to 1 and restart the Setup.

**or enter short command for complete installation in a terminal:
	° sudo apt-get install tcl-tls tdom libtk-img (Debian/Ubuntu)
	° sudo emerge dev-tcltk/tls tdom tkimg (Gentoo)
	° sudo yum install tdom tkimg (Fedora)
	° sudo yast -i tkimg tdom (OpenSuse)
	° sudo urpmi tkimg tdom (Mandriva)
 
***or in a terminaln: tclsh /home/[MYNAME]/Biblepix/biblepix-setup.tcl
 
****Setup makes entries in some system files for BiblePix to be run at system start
(Autostart) and for the background image to change. If this fails you can make the
necessary changes manually:

A )  W I N D O W S

AUTOSTART: in Explorer go to the Autostart directory:

	C:\Users\[MYNAME]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup

and create a link to 

	~\Biblepix\prog\src\biblepix.tcl

BACKGROUND: Settings > Customization and Display > Background (or right-cklick on 
Desktop > Customizing), there enter exact path to image:

	~\Biblepix\TodaysPic\theword.tif

Important: select the 'Single Picture' option! If you have chosen 'Slideshow' in the 
BiblePix Setup, it is BiblePix that will execute a system program which sees that changed
background pictures will be read and displayed anew each time.

B )  L I N U X   D E S K T O P S

Path to single picture: PNG or BMP (exact paths see above "The Word on Picture")
Path for slideshow: ~/Biblepix/TodaysPic/
Path for Autostart: s.a. "Place of installation" (path to main prog)

KDE Plasma
Autostart: Program menu > System settings > Autostart
Background: right-cklick on Desktop > Customize Desktop: choose between Single pic / Slideshow

GNOME
Autostart: Activities > "Tweak Tool" > Startup
Background: Activities > "Tweak Tool" > Desktop > Place: path to single pic!
If Tweak Tool is missing you can install it by entering in a terminal:
	sudo apt-get install gnome-tweak-tool

XFCE4
Autostart: Applications > Settings > Session & Startup > Automatically started applications
Background: Right-click on Desktop > Customize Desktop > Background > Directory 
Important: select either single pic or slideshow!

 
*****Arabic and Hebrew text is positioned automatically on the opposite side
To display such texts in terminals you need programs like 'mlterm', 'gnome-terminal', 'xfce4-terminal' 
or 'Konsole' (KDE) which can display bidirectional text correctly.

******Evolution mail client: save signature file as HTML!

N O T E S   O N   L I N U X   D E S K T O P S

From the plentitude of Linux Desktops, BiblePix has considered the most common ones as follows:

a) X11: KDE/GNOME/XFCE4 : Autostart + Background change fully automatic, in case of problems s.a. 

b) X11: DWM and hopefully many other exotics: 
	Autostart: not automatic, in ~/.xinitrc or ~/.xsession add path to main prog
	Background change: automatic by BiblePix if 'xloadimage' or 'display' (ImageMagick) is installed 

c) Wayland: (very experimental!)
		Sway:
			Autostart: automatic (entry in ~/.config/sway/config)
			Background: automatic by BiblePix
		Weston: 
			Autostart: unknown
			Background: not automatic, following entry in ~/.config/weston.ini possible:
				[shell]
				background-image=[IMAGEPATH]/theword.png
				background-type=scale-crop

If you log in by password you are probably using one of the below Login Managers.
You have the possibility to see the BiblePix image right at Login. (This is beyond 
the scope of the Biblepix Setup program.)
Since these settings require root rights you'll have to make the changes yourself,
either as root or using 'sudo' before the commands (NO LINE BREAKS!).

1) XDM (general Linux)
	A. Entry in /etc/X11/xdm/Xsetup:
		xsetbg /home/YOURNAME/Biblepix/Image/theword.tif &
	B. Optional entry in /etx/X11/xdm/Xresources to move login window down right:
		xlogin*geometry: 1000x350-20-20
	
The program 'xloadimage' must be installed.

2) KDM (KDE Plasma)
	A. Entry in /etc/kde4/kdm/kdmrc, below [X-*-Core]:
		UseBackground=true
		UseTheme=false
		BackgroundCfg=/etc/kde4/kdm/backgroundrc
		GreeterPos=75,75
	B. Entry in /etc/kde4/kdm/backgroundrc:
		[Desktop0]
		BackgroundMode=Wallpaper
		WallpaperMode=Tiled
		Wallpaper=/home/YOURNAME/Biblepix/Image/theword.*

3) GDM (Gnome2/3)
	The following commands have proven successful (no line breaks!):

	Gnome3 (current):
	sudo -u gdm gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri file:///home/YOURNAME/Biblepix/Image/theword.bmp

	Gnome2 (till 2011):
	sudo -u gdm gconftool-2 --direct --config-source xml:readwrite:/etc/gconf/gconf.xml.mandatory --type string --set /desktop/gnome/background/picture_filename /home/YOURNAME/Biblepix/Image/theword.bmp

4) Lightdm (Gnome3, Ubuntu)
	Enter the following command as an ordinary user (no line breaks!):
		dbus-send --system --print-reply --dest=org.freedesktop.Accounts /org/freedesktop/Accounts/User$(id -u) org.freedesktop.Accounts.User.SetBackgroundFile string:/home/YOURNAME/Biblepix/Image/theword.png
