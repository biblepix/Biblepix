For only 1 picture per day, unset this feature (see above).\n\nThe TEXT POSITION window allows you to put $dw wherever you like on your screen. Moreover, when adding a photograph to the $bp photo collection, you can position the text individually. \n\nFONT SIZE is set automatically on the basis of the screen height. You may however change letter size and weight to taste (bigger letters = better contrast).\n\nFONT COLOUR can be accidental or set by you. Note that $bp may adjust colour luminance on the basis of background brightness. This takes effect only after a photo has been added to the $bp collection. \n\nShould the new background image fail to appear, please consult the Manual page for a solution."

If refitting is required, you will be asked to choose the desired section of the photo as well as the position of future Bible texts.\n\nAt any rate, the original photo remains unchanged."

Signature files are stored by language shortcut (e.g. signature-en_Englis.txt) in the directory \n\n\t$sigdir \n\nYou can edit these files from your e-mail program, or in a text editor, and add any personal information (greetings, address etc.) at the top. Any text above the separating line ==== will remain untouched when 'The Word' changes. \n\nYou may not desire $dw to appear in your mails in all languages installed. In the checkboxes top right, please choose those languages you deem appropriate for your mail recipients.\n\nFinally you must instruct your e-mail program to use these signature files (generally under Options>Signatures).\n\nCertain programs like Seamonkey Mail, Evolution or Trojitá manage signatures internally. Among these $bp can handle Trojitá and Evolution for now."
